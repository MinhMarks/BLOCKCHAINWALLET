class Transaction:  
	This is a class representing a transaction in the blockchain. 	
	Attributes:
     		fromAddress (string): The sender of this transaction 
     		toAddress(string): the receiver of this transaction 
     		amount(int):  The quantity of the asset being transferred
     		signature(string): the signature of this transaction 
    
     	Method: CalculateHash
		Caculate the SHA-256 hash of the transaction's contents.
		Returns: (string) The computed hash.
    	
	Method: IsValid 
		return true if this transaction is valid 

class Block: 
	This is a block in block chain 
	Atttributes: 
		timestamp(time_t): when this block be created
		hash(string): the hash string of this block 
		transactions(vector<Transaction>): transactions in this block 
		nonce(int):  a pseudo-random number that is utilized as a counter during the process of mining
		previousHash: the hash string of previous block 
	
	Method: Block 
		initial set up data for Block 
		timestamp(time_t): when this block be created
		transactions(vector<Transaction>): transactions in this block 
		previousHash(string): the hash string of previous block 
	
	Method: CalculateHash
		Caculate the SHA-256 hash of the block contents.
		Returns: (string) The computed hash.
	Method: MineBlock
		Finding a hash for block with satisfy the difficulty.
		Parameters:
		nDifficulty(int): The number of leading zeros required in the hash.

class Blockchain: 
	this is set of linked block 
	Atttributes:
		miningReward(int): incentive when user mined the hash satisfy requirement 
		chain(vector<Block>): blocks of this blockchain 
		pendingTransactions(vector<Transaction>): transactions that wating user to find satisfy hash. 
	Method: Blockchain  
		initial this blockchain with a empty block
	
	Method: MinePendingTransactions 
		Confirm mining action, when the block has mined send reward for user 
		Parameters:
		miningRewardAddress(string): send reward to this address

	Method: AddTransaction
		push transaction to pendingTransaction. At this action, user's transaction has not been added to the block yet    
		Parameters:
		newT(Transaction): the signed transaction 
	Method GetBalanceOfAddress 
		
		Parameters: 
		Address(string): function will return balance of this address 

	Method IsChainValid: 
		check if this chain Legal
